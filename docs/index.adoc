Welcome to the Code FREAK documentation.
Code FREAK is an online IDE for educational purposes that allows teachers to create and enroll programming tasks
allows students to programm and execute their code without leaving the browser. Submissions can be evaluated
automatically by various testing-methods like unit tests or code smell detection.

WARNING: Code FREAK is under heavy development. Things might break between updates even if we try to be backwards-compatible.

== Getting started
If you are new to Code FREAK here are some links that may help you to understand the basic concepts of the system:

* link:architecture.adoc[Architecture of Code FREAK]
* link:development.adoc[Development Setup]
* More resources coming soon...

== Security
We utilize Linux containers based on Docker which allow a good logical isolation (separate process-set, resource-limits, â€¦).
It should be very difficult to escape from the containers and do harm to the underlying host-system but we do not guarantee
that it is impossible. This is why we recommend to run a dedicated Docker daemon only for Code FREAK that does nothing
else except hosting the IDE instances and running untrusted code.
Additionally you should not run the Code FREAK application and its sidekick Docker daemon on the same host for similar
reasons: If someone manages to escape the IDE containers they could hijack the backend application and steal sensitive
information. Even if someone does not accomplishes to break out of the container they could spin up so many containers
that all host system resources are exhausted.

== Installation
There are various methods to run the application in production. We only support the Docker/docker-compose setup.
If you plan to run the application directly on a host-system you should know what you are doing. If you are looking
for a development setup please take a look at the <<Development / Contribution>> section.

=== Prerequisites
For the backend application:

* A Docker host/daemon
* About 1-2GB RAM

For the dedicated docker daemon:

* Separated Docker daemon that does not run on the same host as the backend application
* Lots of memory. You should plan 3-4GB RAM per concurrent user (depending on the
programming language). We are working on reducing the RAM usage.
* About CPU 1 Core / concurrent 10 users

=== Preparing the Docker daemon
Docker allows to connect via HTTP/TLS to the integrated API. This requires to set up a PKI for certificate-management.
There is an extensive documentation on how to do this in the official Docker docs.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/[Please follow this article] carefully. As the result you should have
a `ca.pem`, `cert.pem` and `key.pem` file that can be used on your backend application host.

=== Set up using Docker Compose
We have included a sample `docker-compose.yml` in the main repository. This should work fine out-of-the-box but uses
a Docker-in-Docker container which is not suited for development. Please remove the `docker` service and adjust the
environment-variables of the `app` service that it points to your dedicated Docker host. Place the `ca.pem`, `cert.pem`
and `key.pem` files in a directoy `certificates` next to your `docker-compose.yml` and adjust the configuration
accordingly:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    # ... SNIP ...
    volumes:
      - "./certificates:/var/code-freak/certs"
    environment:
      DOCKER_HOST: "http://docker-host.at-your-company.domain.com:2376"
      DOCKER_CERT_PATH: "/var/code-freak/certs"
      # ... SNIP ...
```

== Configuration
`TODO explain most simple way to provide a configuration file for the Docker container`

For more details refer to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files[Spring documentation].

=== Authentication
Code FREAK provides multiple ways to authenticate users. You can choose one of the following methods to integrate the application with your existing infrastructure.

==== Simple Authentication
Simple authentication means that users are managed by Code FREAK itself. Accounts are created by administrators and saved to the database.

WARNING: Simple authentication has not been implemented yet! It only works in `dev` mode with preconfigured users. See https://github.com/code-freak/code-freak/issues/122[#122] for progress.

```yaml
code-freak.authentication-method: simple # this is the default
```

==== LDAP
Code FREAK can connect to an LDAP server and use it for authentication. A minimal configuration requires the URL of the server and a mapping from LDAP groups to Code FREAK roles.

As an example, you can find an LDAP test server https://github.com/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap[here]. It can be used with the following configuration.
```yaml
code-freak:
  authentication-method: ldap
  ldap:
    url: ldap://127.0.0.1:389
    root-dn: dc=planetexpress,dc=com
    group-search-base: ou=people
    role-mappings.admin_staff: admin
    role-mappings.ship_crew: student
    #active-directory: true (set this if you are using an Active Directory server)
```

=== LTI 1.3 Integration
Code FREAK supports integration with Learn Management Systems (LMS) like Moodle or Canvas via the LTI 1.3 standard.
Before you begin make sure your LMS supports the LTI 1.3 standard. LTI 1.0 and 2.0 are *NOT* supported!
You need the following information from your LMS:

* LTI authentication URL
* LTI/OAuth 2.0 token URL
* URL to receive the JWK-set of the LMS
* A client ID (should be generated by your LMS when registering an external tool)

In addition you need to create an RSA keypair and put them into a Java key store. This is required
to cryptographically sign the messages send between Code FREAK and the LMS.

==== Generate the RSA key pair and Java key store
The following instructions will show you how to generate an RSA key pair with the Java `keytool` and how to
extract the public key (often needed for you LMS) with `openssl`.
You will need to have `openssl` and the JDK's `keytool` installed. Please consult a search engine of your choice
how to do this for your platform.

===== Generate the keystore:
This will create a file called `cf-keys.pkcs12` with a public/private key pair.
```
$ keytool -genkey \
  -keystore cf-keys.p12 \
  -storepass "supersecurepassword123" \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -alias codefreak \
  -validity 10950
```

===== Export public key in PEM format:
This will extract the public key (without certificate information) from the pkcs12 file you just created.
You may need this information when registering Code FREAK as external tool in your CMS.
```
$ openssl pkcs12 -in cf-keys.pkcs12 -nokeys | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQE ...
```

==== Register Code FREAK as LTI Tool
Please check the manual of your LMS how to register external LTI 1.3 Tools. If required please use the following
information.

Please replace `[code-freak-url]` with the public accessible URL of your Code FREAK installation including `http(s)://...`


|===
|Attribute |Value

|Tool Name
|Code FREAK

|Tool URL
|`[code-freak-url]`

|LTI Version
|1.3

|Public key
|The exported public key from the previous step

|Login URL
|`[code-freak-url]/lti/login`

|Redirect URLs
|`[code-freak-url]/lti/launch`

|Deep Linking (Content Selection) URL
|`[code-freak-url]/lti/select-content`

|Icon URL
|`[code-freak-url]/static/img/lti-code-icon.png`
|===

The LMS should generate a Client ID for you. Please write it down for the next step.

==== Configuring Code FREAK for LTI
Please put the key store file in a location where the Code FREAK process can read it. If you are running
Code FREAK with Docker you may have to mount the generated key store as volume inside the container.

Adjust the configuration with all the information you received from your LMS. The following is an example
that should work with Moodle 3.7 and later:

```yaml
code-freak:
  lti:
    enabled: true
    key-store: file:/path/to/your/keystore/cf-keys.p12
    key-store-type: PKCS12
    # for pkcs12 key stores the store password and entry pin are always the same
    key-store-password: supersecurepassword123
    providers:
      - name: Some human-readable name
        issuer: "https://lms.example.org"
        client-id: client-id-from-your-lms
        auth-url: "https://lms.example.org/mod/lti/auth.php"
        token-url: "https://lms.example.org/mod/lti/token.php"
        jwk-url: "https://lms.example.org/mod/lti/certs.php"
        key-store-entry-name: codefreak
        key-store-entry-pin: supersecurepassword123
```
