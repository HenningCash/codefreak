= Roles

Code FREAK has a hierarchical role system: Each user will receive one of the following rules depending on the configuration:

* `admin`
* `teacher`
* `student`

The permissions obtained with each role are currently very limited.
Basically, `teachers` can manage their own tasks and assignments.
`students` can only work on assignments.
`admins` have access to all assignments.

Below is a list with basic permissions for each role.
