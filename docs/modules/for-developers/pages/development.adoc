== Configuration
Create a file `src/main/resources/application-dev.yml`. For documentation on how to configure the
server see https://github.com/codefreak/codefreak/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yml[`application.yml`]
in the same directory. Minimum configuration that uses the in-memory database:

[source,yaml]
[source]
-----
spring.jpa.database: HSQL
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto: update
-----

=== Database
You can either use the embedded HSQL storage or a PostgreSQL database. Data from the HSQL database will get lost when
the application shuts down. For Postgres create at least a dedicated database and adjust the configuration accordingly:

[source,yaml]
[source]
-----
spring:
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/codefreak"
    username: postgres
    password: portgres
    driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
  jpa:
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
-----

=== Docker
For many parts of the application we need connection to a (dedicated) Docker daemon. By default we use the default
socket for your platform. If you are on Linux please follow the installation guidelines for your distribution.
For Windows, MacOS and other OS that cannot run Docker natively you will either need the official Docker for Windows/MacOS
software stacks or use the Vagrant machine that is included in this repository. The Vagrant machine will make the Docker
daemon available at `127.0.0.1:2375` (the official Docker port). If you setup Docker for Windows/MacOS the Daemon should
be reachable on the same address. So if you are on Windows or MacOS adjust your `application-dev.properties` file so it points
at a Docker daemon.

[source,yaml]
[source]
-----
codefreak:
  docker:
    host: "tcp://127.0.0.1:2375"
-----

== Run the application
If you use IntelliJ simply start the `CodeFreakApplication` Spring Boot application.
For Gradle run the command `./gradlew bootRun`. The application is started at `http://localhost:8080`.

== Authentication
The following sample users are pre-configured for development.

.Sample Users
|===
|Username |Password |Role

|admin
|123
|ADMIN

|teacher
|123
|TEACHER

|student
|123
|STUDENT
|===

== Running tests
To run the tests you need a working Docker connection. It is also possible to use the Vagrant machine for Testing:

[source,shell]
[source]
-----
$ ./gradlew test          # for testing with local Docker daemon
$ ./gradlew vagrantTest   # for testing with Vagrant Docker daemon
-----

== Fix linting issues

[source,console]
[source]
-----
$ ./gradlew spotlessApply
-----

== Making changes to the database schema
If you modify the entity layer under `org.codefreak.codefreak.entity` in a way that changes the database schema,
you have to create a migration changelog. Code FREAK uses https://www.liquibase.org/[Liquibase] for versioning the database
schema. After you made your changes to the JPA entities, execute the script `generateChangelog.sh` in the project directory.
It will create a new file under `src/main/resources/db/changelogs`. It contains differences between the latest schema version
and the JPA entities. Modify the file if needed, for example if you create a new non-null column, add a `value` that is used
for existing records. Keep in mind that the migration will be run on existing production databases. Please refer to the
http://www.liquibase.org/documentation[Liquibase documentation] for more information on changelogs.

NOTE: If you are on Windows, the script does not work on all emulated shells. Make sure to use one that is based on `bash`.

== Releasing a new version

The project is split up into a main application and some auxiliary that have there own repositories (e.g. the IDE).
There are different release processes depending on the project. All repositories use https://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

Most projects produce a Docker image as their main artifact. The following tags are automatically created/updated by CI:

* `latest` -> latest released version
* `<major>` -> latest release with this major version
* `<major>.<minor>` -> latest release with this major and minor version
* `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` -> each specific release
* `canary` -> latest build from master (not necessarily released yet)


WARNING: If you need at least a specific version of a Docker image as a dependency, you need to create a new major release
of the depending AND the dependent project. This is necessary event if the dependent version is downwards compatible.
This is a limitation of the tag system introduced above.

=== Advanced release process via CI

NOTE: This is currently only used by the main application https://github.com/codefreak/codefreak[`codefreak/codefreak`].

To release a new version, https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-08-24-trigger-custom-build[trigger a custom CI build] with the
following configuration (use actual version number). Run the task on the appropriate major version branch (currently
only `master` is supported).

[source]
[source]
-----
env:
  - RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
-----

=== Simple release process

NOTE: This is used by all project that are not mentioned in the advanced release process section.

To release a new version, simply create a GitHub release (tag) in the form `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (no prefix).
